Run on local host 

http://127.0.0.1:5173/
is my react app made with vite js

In my journey learning react js,  I came across several powerful hooks that significantly improved the way I manage state and logic in my components.


In this course i learnt about the folllowing 

-I learnt about useState, useEffect, useRef, useConext 


1. Found in the State Management folder src of my app 
   The useState hook  was one of the first hooks I encountered while learning React. it allowed me to add state to my functional components. Just like how I used the map function , filter fuction , controlled inputs.

2. Found in the UseEffect folder src of my app is 
   The useEffect hook  was another essential hook in my React journey. It allowed me to perform side effects in my components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM. 


3. Found in the UseContext folder src of my app is 
   The useContext hook, when I needed to share state or data across multiple components without using prop drilling, useContext came to the rescue. It allowed me to create a context and provide a value to be consumed by nested child components.

4. Found in the UseRef folder src of my app is 
   The useRef hook, it provided a way to create a mutable reference that persisted across re-renders. Initially, I found it helpful for accessing DOM elements directly 


5. Finally I learnt how to create my own custom hook
